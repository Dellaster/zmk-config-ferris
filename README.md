WORK IN PROGRESS

34-key Sweep wireless firmware using the aptV3 keyboard layout by Apsu with a few prose-centric tweaks (e.g. swapped forward-slash with dash; changed the shifted comma, dot, and dash to ?, !, and * respectively. The * is for ease of markdown, reasoning for the others should be obvious to a fiction writer.): https://github.com/Apsu/APT
